# MineSweeperGame
Disappointed the new windows minesweeper had ads and a paywall so I built my own. All runs in java and in manually coded Java swing so please note that I am not a graphic designer... Had a lot of fun making this but less so debugging it. All strings are stored in arrays so menus and buttons are created looping over arrays rather than initialising individually to save time.
